# Supply-Chain-Dashboard-1

Problem Statement:
How did service levels affect contract renewal for customers? 

Step 1) Clean and handle null values in data on Excel 

-Line Fill Rate is used to understand how many lines have been shipped out of the total lines ordered

-Volume fill rate or case fill rate is used to understand the total quantity we can ship for a customer per order or for a given period

-On-time Rate determines if an order is delivered as per the agreed time with the customer

-In full Rate determines if an order is delivered in full as per the requested quantity by the customer

-On time In Full (OTIF) Rate determines if an order is delivered both in full and On Time as per the customer order request

All other metrics are significantly below their targets except for Line Fill Rate and Volume Fill Rate. This dashboard is a useful starting point to understand the factors contributing to the delayed service rates. Potential causes might include:

-Poor route optimization

-Inefficient inventory management

-Production delays

-Inefficient workload processes

-Inadequate vendor relationships within the supply chain

Recommendations:

-Data Collection: Gather data from the beginning of the supply chain, focusing on where products are procured from and their average shipping and lead times. Compare this data with the time it takes for full products to reach customers.

-Route Optimization: Identify and implement optimal route choices and select vendors that offer the lowest shipping times.

-Inventory Management: Improve inventory management practices to ensure that customers receive their products in the least number of shipments and in full.

-Production Efficiency: Address production delays by streamlining processes and eliminating bottlenecks by using demand forecasting techniques.

-Vendor Relationships: Strengthen relationships with vendors to enhance the reliability and efficiency of your supply chain.

-Assess the key reasons why previous customers discontinued their contracts with our company. Determine whether the causes were related to pricing, customer service, logistics, competitive offers, or other factors. Gather data to address and resolve these issues.
